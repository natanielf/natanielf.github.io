This project started 2 years ago while I was a freshman in my Computer Information System class. Ever since, I've updated and improved it. I've learned a lot about web design, programming, and [Git version control](https://git-scm.com/) from it and for that I'm thankful.

### Inspiration and Attributions:

- [ ] Light/dark mode toggle feature as well as `@media (prefers-color-scheme: light/dark)` in css
