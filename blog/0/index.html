        Hi! This is the first post in my new blog. Why, you might ask, did I
        choose the name "Index"? Well, I don't have a great answer for you other
        than that it's somewhat related to programming. (In general, the term
        can refer to the position of an element in an array, and it also happens
        to be the
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server_directory_index"
          target="_blank"
          >name of the HTML file</a
        >
        you are currently viewing.) As I'm sure many people in the space are
        aware,
        <a
          href="https://www.karlton.org/2017/12/naming-things-hard/"
          target="_blank"
          >naming things is hard</a
        >.
      </p>

        The main purpose of this blog is to provide a space where I can share
        personal thoughts and updates about projects I'm working on. As such, I
        don't know how often I will be posting here. It will likely just be
        occasional updates here and there when I have something to share. As you
        can probably already tell, I plan to keep these posts pretty informal.
      </p>

        Anyways, I'll keep this post short because I don't have much to report
        at the moment. Thanks for reading!
