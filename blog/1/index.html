      <p>
        The 2023

        occured from Jun. 23<sup>rd</sup> to Jun. 25<sup>th</sup>. Each team was
        given two random genres and they can choose to make a film that
        incorporates either one or both. All the teams shared the same
        requirements, including a required character, prop, and line of
        dialogue.

        All day on Jun. 24<sup>th</sup>, I was the boom operator on the set of

            >The Lockbox</a

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@drewfilm" target="_blank"
          >Drew Floyd</a
        >, and consisted mainly of friends from his high school and Chapman
        University. The film also featured the elusive

        who shall remain nameless. I had a lot of fun working with everyone on
        set at the various locations we filmed at. Everyone worked really hard
        to make the best short film possible because we were all genuinely
        passionate about filmmaking.

        On Aug. 12<sup>th</sup>, we attended the 2023 San Diego 48 Hour Film
        Project Best of Screening. I am proud to report that
        <i>The Lockbox</i> won in three categories: Best Ensemble Cast, Best
        Dance Choreography, and Best Musical Score! I think it's awesome that a
        group of college kids could compete with dozens of other teams from San
        Diego, many of which consisted of industry professionals.
