I try not to work too carefully, since I may become tall and have to stay inside. Sometimes I go to the house with my friends, or we can sleep at Justin's house. The zoo is an old place to visit, and I can get free people at the library. Of course, I also have to mow the tree, water the dogs, and clean my airplane sometimes.
